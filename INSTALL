General compilation:
-----------------

Qonk uses GNU Autoconf to manage the compilation. Call

        ./configure --help

to see available options.

Like all good applications Qonk is able to be run without installation. It tries
to find its data files in ./data first and uses $(pkgdatadir)/data in a second
attempt.

Dependencies:
-------------
Qonk tries to only use components available in free software operating systems.

Install the development version of the following packages in order to compile
from source:

        SDL (>= 1.2)
        SDL_ttf (>= 2.0)
        SDL_gfx (>= 1.2)
        SDL_image (>= 1.2)

Qonk includes a modified version of guichan 0.6.1 in its sources and statically
links that into the executable. The build system was not tested to use a
system-wide installation of guichan 0.6.1. Furthermore since guichan is not
extensively used in Qonk it is planned to remove it in further releases.
