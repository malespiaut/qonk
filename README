Qonk
====

Qonk is a small build-and-conquer strategy game with very simple rules. A
complete game only lasts for a few minutes and can be a fun break away from
work or whatever you're doing.

The setting of the game is a solar system of planets. Your goal is to conquer
all of the planets in the game by sending ships there. Planets that are 
under your control generate new ships. Simple AI players are playing against
you. As you gain more experience throughout the game, more AI players have to
be kicked out of bigger solar systems.

The game is currently very much in beta.

For information on how to compile the source code refer to the INSTALL file.

How to play
-----------

The goal is wipe out all enemies from the solar system. 

Select a group of planets to put their ships into your selection for the next
move. Now do a right-click near the planet where you want to send you fleet to.
You can attack neutral (grey), enemy (some color) and reinforce your own planets
(the white ones).

The number of ships starting from a planet depends on the number of ships being
stationed there and the current fleet strength setting. In the beginning the
strength is set to 50%. That means that half of the ships on each selected 
planet will take off when you order them to move. You can choose other
strength settings by pressing the number keys (1 -> 10%, 9 -> 90%, 0->100%).
If you press the 's' key you are in single ship mode. This means that on each
move order one ship leaves from the selected planets (there has to be at least
one stationed, though).

Besides setting the strength to certain values you can lower or higher the
strength by using the mouse wheel. Below 10% comes the single ship mode,
when requesting to lower the strength it switches to 100%. The same happens in
the reverse order when you increase the strength and are at 100%.

New ships are continuisly built on the planets (and moons) you own. Bigger
planets usually built ships faster than smaller ones.

Ships stationing at a planet or moon are automatically defending it. The rule
is simple: One defending ship destroys one attacking ships and vice versa. A
planet or moon defended by N ships can only be conquered by at least N + 1
ships.

Other options
-------------

You can toggle displaying of enemy ships by pressing the 'e' key.

If you see yourself losing and want to retry, press 'r'. If you have won instead
press 'n' to start the next round.

Press 'f' to switch between fullscreen and windowed mode. In windowed mode you
need to make sure that the mouse cannot leave the game's window. Press 'g' to
activate input grabbing and press it again if you want to release the input.

To pause the game just press ESC to open the menus. Pressing ESC again puts you
back into the action.

Command line options
--------------------

Start the game with qonk <numberOfPlanets> <numberOfComputerPlayers> to run a
game with such a universe.

Config file
-----------

On GNU/Linux and other POSIX-like systems a config file is written in your
home directory at .qonk/qonk.config.

The format is LISP-like (you remember it from SuperTuxKart probably :) ).

Development
-----------

Plans are there to add a single-computer multiplayer mode. Feel free to
contact the development team via the mailing-list.

Issues
------
- You cannot select ships which are already in the vasts of space.

Qonk uses a number of free software components (libraries) for which we thank
their authors:

Simple Direct Media Library: http://libsdl.org
 * This library is truly a gem!

Guichan: http://guichan.sf.net
 * Provides us some user interface components and made the menu system
   implementation easier.

GNU Autotools: http://gnu.org/software/autoconf
               http://gnu.org/software/automake
 * These make lifes for packagers and people who cross-compile so much easier.
   Unfortunately many people do not understand all the issues around compiling,
   linking and installing on different platforms and coping with compatibility
   and blame the Autotools for being the root of all evil.
