Qonk 0.0.3
==========

Qonk is a small build-and-conquer strategy game with very simple rules. A
complete game only lasts for a few minutes and can be a fun break away from
work or whatever you're doing.

The setting of the game is a solar system of planets. Your goal is to conquer
all of the planets in the game by sending ships there. Planets that are 
under your control generate new ships. Simple AI players are playing against
you. As you gain more experience throughout the game, more AI players have to
be kicked out of bigger solar systems.

The game is currently very much in beta and was written and published by
Anthony Liekens.

Dependencies
------------
To compile the program you will need to install SDL, SDL_ttf and SDL_gfx. It is
built using GNU Autoconf. In a published tarball you only need to execute

  ./configure
  make
  make install

You get helpful error messages if something is not correct with the
dependencies.

If you want to built the sources from SVN you need to issue ./autogen.sh and
have the autotools installed (GNU Automake, GNU Autoconf, GNU libtool).

How to play
-------------

Select a group of planets to put their ships into your selection for the next
move. Now do a right-click near the planet where you want to send you fleet to.
You can attack neutral (grey), enemy (some color) and reinforce your own planets
(the white ones).

The number of ships starting from a planets depends on the number of ships being
stationed there and the current fleet strength setting. In the beginning the
strength is set to 50%. That means that half of the ships on each planets will
take off when you order them to move. You can choose other strength settings by
pressing the number keys (1 -> 10%, 9 -> 90%, 0->100%). If you press the 's' key
you are in single ship mode. This means that on each move order one ship leaves
from the selected planets (there has to be at least one stationed, though).

Besides setting the strength to certain values you can lower or higher the
strength by using the mouse wheel. Below 10% comes the single ship mode,
when requesting to lower the strength it switches to 100%. The same happens in
the reverse order when you increase the strength and are at 100%.

New ships are continuisly built on the planets (and moons) you own. Bigger
planets usually built ships faster than smaller ones.

Other options
-------------

You can toggle displaying of enemy ships by pressing the 'e' key.

If you see yourself losing and want to retry, press 'r'. If you have won instead
press 'n' to start the next round.

Press 'f' to switch between fullscreen and windowed mode. In windowed mode you
need to make sure that the mouse cannot leave the game's window. Press 'g' to
activate input grabbing and press it again if you want to release the input.

Last but not least 'p' can be used to pause and unpause the game and 'ESC' quits
it.

Command line options
--------------------

Start the game with qonk <numberOfPlanets> <numberOfComputerPlayers> to run a
game with such a universe.

Config file
-----------

On GNU/Linux and other POSIX-like systems a config file is written in your
home directory at .qonk/qonk.config.

The format is LISP-like (you remember it from SuperTuxKart probably :) ). At the
moment editing the config file is the only possibility to switch the various
of the game except for the fullscreen mode state and the game's progress which
are saved on exit.

If you feel sufficiently experienced you can change the input configuration of
the game. Don't use escape or g in any of your mappings, because those are
hardcoded to quitting and toggling the input grab.

Development
-----------

Plans are there to add a menu system, some GUI components and perhaps
a single-computer multiplayer mode. Feel free to contact the development team
via the mailing-list.

Issues
------
- You cannot select ships which are already in the vasts of space.
