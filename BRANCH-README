About this branch
-----------------

This development branch has been created on 2007-06-12 to abstract the
way Qonk handles its input. The result of this work should be that it
will be much easier to change input mappings. This will allow playing Qonk
properly on devices with only a single mouse button or no keyboard.

Scope:
------

 - remove direct access to keysym values [done]
 - introduce event layer which consists of stuff like quit game,
   next level, set fleet strength [done]
 - introduce input mapping [done]
 - allow 2 inputs for one game action [done]
 - read input mapping from config file [done]
 - write input mapping to config file [done]
 - write functions that creates a human readable string for an input
   * one that can be used in messages like "press the [N] key for next level"
   * one that can be used to present a mapping in detail: "cursor up: mouse y-" [done]
 - introduce graphical items to trigger the events (perhaps buttons) [postponed]
 - update game manual [done]

Status:
-------

- Basic input abstraction complete.
